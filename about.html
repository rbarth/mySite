			<h3>Rebecca Marie Barth</h3>
			</br>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am a junior web designer/writer born and raised in the Grand Rapids area. I am finishing up my degree in Web Design and Development at Davenport University and working on building my portfolio and increasing my skill set.</p>
			</br>

			<p><strong>History</strong> Originally a psychology and writing major, I decided to change tracks and embrace the digital age into which I was born. My mentor and brother-in-law --<a href="http://andrewbredow.com/">Andrew Bredow</a>-- introduced me to the world of web design and development, where I discovered that I could utilize my passions for art, design, and writing in addition to new skills in css and html to create websites.  </p>
			</br>

			<p><strong>Hobbies</strong> When not designing or developing websites, I am an avid reader, amateur novelist, and beginner violinist. I also enjoy eating new foods, seeing new places, and trying new activities just to say that I have (I can now say that water-skiing, snowboarding, and paint-balling are not among my talents). While my ventures into outdoor activities are typically one time deals, I plan to continue reading, writing, and playing violin for many years to come.</p>
