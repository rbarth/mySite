Blogging For Dummies
No, I didn't actually read the book Blogging for Dummies, although I was unsurprised to see that it actually does exist. For all that I enjoy writing, this is the first blog post I have ever written.

I could write a post about why I chose this color scheme for my website, but it would be more like a paragraph than a post. So here it goes. (link to another post here? is that possible? then the below content would be an separate post instead.)

So that was me in colors, how else could I represent myself? Rather than using real photographs of places I have been or would like to go, I decided to make the backgrounds of the pages
