title:  "Blogging for Dummies"
excerpt: "No, I didn't actually read the book Blogging for Dummies, although I was not surprised to find that it actually did exist. Perhaps I should have read the book though, since for all that I enjoy writing, this is the first blog post I have ever written."

When I decided that I would add a blogging page to my website, I put off deciding what exactly I was going to blog about. So when I had the paged designed and built and ready for some content, I sat and waited for inspiration to strike.

I spun around in my chair a few times, doodled on a piece of scrap paper, and then went and made a frappe. Ten minutes and a burst of caffeine-induced energy later, I sat back down at my desk and thought about what exactly I wanted out of this blog. Why do people blog? To make their ideas, thoughts, and opinions heard. So what thoughts did I want the world to hear?

As I am just starting out in web design and development, I don't as of yet have any ideas that will revolutionize the industry, but when I do develop any interesting insights into the world of web d&d, I will be sure to share them. In the mean time, please enjoy my irregular blogs and me and my many other eclectic interests.
