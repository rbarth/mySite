  <h4>Homestyle Cooking at the Chuckwagon Café</h4>
  </br>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis site is a mockup created for learning purposes, though the Café and client were quite real.
  The owners of the restaurant gave details for what they would desire in
  a website and provided images and information pertinent to the creation of the mockup.</p>

  <p><strong>Backstory</strong> I met with the clients first at the Café itself, in order to obtain a
  better feel of the business, and a taste of their homestyle cooking. They showed me around and explained a bit about the history
  of the restaurant and how they came to own it, and then we delved into what exactly they would look for in a website.</p>
  <p><strong>Specifications</strong> The most important element was that the mockup would match the overall theme of the cafe,
  which was rustic and western. The cafe did not have a logo, nor any real form of advertising, so it was important that the
  mockup focus on what would bring people to the area, to ensure that the site capitalized on the fact that the cafe was
  located right on a major highway, M-66. Another specification for any website they would want was that the site would be
  simple and easy to manage, as with their tight budget, if they could afford a website, they would rather manage all upkeep
  of the site themselves.</p>
  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Theme: Colors were selected with the western theme of the cafe in mind, with browns and reds
    as the main colors, accented by lighter colors such as white and peach.</p>
    <p> Logo: The logo I created also follows the western
    theme, and is a simple chuckwagon with the initials "CC" cut out of the body.</p>

    <p>Area: A section of the website was dedicated to other attractions in the area, including festivals and the nearby casino.
    The convenience of having the cafe directly on M-66 was mentioned in several places throughout the website, and
    further information about the highway itself and the other attractions on the route were placed into the footer on each
    page.</p>
    <p>Simplicity: Keeping in mind that the clients would want to maintain the website themselves, the site was created to
    be as clear cut as possible. Templates would also be used to ensure that only the parts of the website that they might
    wish to change (festival information, menu items, images, etc.) would be editable, maintaining the overall structure of
    the website. Additionally, all the editable code would be well commented in order to explain what each section did and
    how it could be altered as needed.
